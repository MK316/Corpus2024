## üå± Objective 
+ Students will be able to infer the topic using a Word Cloud. Later, they will elaborate on their ideas using a word frequency list

## üå± Introduction to content and context 
+ McDonald's, the famous fast-food giant, has thousands of restaurants worldwide, serving millions of customers daily. Started in 1940 by the McDonald brothers, it quickly became a pioneer in fast food, simplifying menus and speeding up service. With Ray Kroc's acquisition in 1954, McDonald's grew into a massive global enterprise. Now, it's a symbol of quick and familiar dining, with its roots honored at the McDonald's museum in California.

There are many restaurants in the world but probably the most famous is McDonald's. McDonald's has more than 34,000 restaurants around the world in 119 countries and they serve about 68 million customers every day. The story of McDonald's began in 1940 when two brothers, Richard and Maurice (Mac) McDonald, opened a new restaurant called 'McDonald's Famous Barbeque". It was a successful business but the brothers wanted to sell more food and make more money, so in 1948 they made some changes. For example, they tried a new way to cook and serve food faster - and McDonald's became one of the first fast food restaurants in the world. In addition, they made the menu more simple: hamburgers, cheeseburgers, sodas and milkshakes. There were no longer any waitresses to serve food, so customers ordered food by themselves at a counter. In 1954, a man called Ray Kroc joined the company and later bought it for 2.7 million dollars. The company is now worth many billions of dollars. There is a McDonald's museum that is located in San Bernardino, California where the first McDonald's was built. It's open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
